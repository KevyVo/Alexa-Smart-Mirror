# Alexa-Smart-Mirror
This mirror has an informational hub that projects through the glass to give you customized features. These include: Time and Calendar, Weather, Calendar updates and many more modules.
It also has the voice assistant Alexa built into it for general question and daily function like an alarm and many more features.
I am still in the process of making a youtube video and a proper hackster.io write up, stay posted for a full guide with my code posted here.
